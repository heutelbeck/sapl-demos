     * Upon receiving a decision from the PDP containing a constraint, i.e. an
     * advice or obligation, the PEP will check all registered ConstraintHandler
     * beans and ask them if they are able to handle a given constraint as defined
     * by the policy.
     *
     * Generally, there is no specific scheme to constraints. Any JSON object may be
     * an appropriate constraint. Its contents solely depends on the domain modeling
     * decisions of the application and policy author.
     *
     * So each ConstraintHandler requires knowledge about the domain. In this case
     * it is assumed, that the constraint object contains a field 'type' to
     * disambiguate different constraints from each other.
     *
     * This ConstraintHandler in particular is for logging messages when access to a
     * resource is granted. Thus, the canHandle method returns true, if the type
     * equals 'message'.
     *
     * The PEP must first check if the runtime environment has the ability to handle
     * the constraint, as it must deny access to the resource if the constraint is
     * an obligation that cannot be handled. In this case no other advice or
     * obligations have to be followed.
     *
     * It is a good practice to validate the overall constraint object given, as an
     * invalid constraint cannot be handled and declining a constraint at this stage
     * leads to a clean behavior in case of obligations.
